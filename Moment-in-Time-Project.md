This document is a "moment in time" snapshot of my learning progress through the IT1050 Programming Logic labs. It captures what I understood and could build at the time — a record of knowledge, practice, and growth.

## Overview

Over the semester I completed a sequence of C# labs that progressively introduced programming fundamentals. The labs moved from basics (I/O and types) to conditionals, arithmetic, collections, and basic object-oriented design. The sections below are short reflections on each lab and the main concepts I walked away with.

---

## Lab One — Getting Started (LabOneContent)

What I knew at this moment
- C# console app structure (`Main`, namespaces).
- Primitive types: `int`, `double`, `string`, `bool`.
- Console I/O with `Console.ReadLine()` and `Console.WriteLine()`.
- Parsing input and basic arithmetic.

Why it mattered
These fundamentals let me accept input, compute results, and display output — the baseline for all subsequent labs.

---

## Lab Two — Decisions and Branching (LabTwoContent)

What I knew at this moment
- Comparison operators: `>`, `<`, `>=`, `<=`, `==`, `!=`.
- Boolean operators: `&&`, `||`, `!`.
- Control flow using `if` / `else if` / `else`.
- Input validation via conditional checks.

Why it mattered
I learned how to make programs react to different inputs, not just process values.

---

## Lab Three — Commission Calculations (CommissionLab)

What I knew at this moment
- Applying percentages and tiered arithmetic.
- Implementing different rates for sales ranges.
- Formatting numeric output (currency, rounding).

Why it mattered
This lab bridged math and business logic, showing how to encode real rules.

---

## Lab Four — Speed Calculations (SpeedLab)

What I knew at this moment
- Translating formulas into code (`speed = distance / time`).
- Classifying results with conditionals (e.g., within limit vs speeding).
- Handling invalid inputs (zero or negative time).

Why it mattered
I practiced implementing and validating mathematical logic.

---

## Lab Five — Odd/Even (OddEven)

What I knew at this moment
- The modulus operator `%` for remainders.
- Determining parity (odd vs even) using `%`.
- Simple conditional branching on parity.

Why it mattered
Small, focused operators like `%` are useful in many algorithmic checks.

---

## Lab Six — Parking Fee Calculator (ParkingCalculator)

What I knew at this moment
- Time arithmetic and rounding up to billing increments.
- Piecewise fee calculations based on duration.
- Breaking a problem into sequential computational steps.

Why it mattered
This lab taught how to convert billing policies into code.

---

## Lab Seven — Employee Model (EmployeeLab)

What I knew at this moment
- Defining a simple `Employee` class with properties.
- Adding methods to encapsulate behaviors like `CalculatePay()`.
- Encapsulation and organizing related data and logic.

Why it mattered
Modeling data as objects improved structure and clarity.

---

## Lab Eight — Employee Lab II (Employeelab2)

What I knew at this moment
- Extending classes with constructors and additional properties.
- Managing multiple objects using arrays or `List<T>`.
- Implementing additional methods (raises, calculations) and possibly simple file I/O.

Why it mattered
Handling many objects and richer models is a step toward real applications.

---

## Lab Nine — Faculty Records (FacultyLab)

What I knew at this moment
- Searching, sorting, and filtering collections of records.
- Iterating collections with loops and applying selection criteria.
- Using library helpers to query and manipulate data.

Why it mattered
Managing and querying collections is central to most applications that work with records.

---

## Lab Ten — Lists and Dynamic Collections (LabList)

What I knew at this moment
- `List<T>`: add, remove, insert, iterate.
- Differences between arrays and dynamic lists.
- Common list algorithms for searching and mutation.

Why it mattered
Dynamic collections kept programs flexible for unpredictable data sizes.

---

## Mini Exams (Mini Exam 1 & Mini Exam 2)

What I knew at this moment
- Reinforced basics: variables, conditionals, loops, arithmetic.
- Practiced problem-solving in constrained settings.

Why it mattered
Short exams identified gaps and built confidence in fundamentals.

---

## VSCode Bonus Lab

What I knew at this moment
- Using the IDE for running, debugging, and stepping through code.
- Leveraging helpful extensions and formatting tools.

Why it mattered
Tooling improved development speed and debugging effectiveness.

---

## Final Quiz

What I knew at this moment
- Reviewed combined topics: types, control flow, collections, and OOP.
- Used the quiz to find areas needing more practice.

Why it mattered
The quiz was a final checkpoint before tackling the final project.

---

## Final Project

What I knew at this moment
- Integrating class design, collections, validation, and user interaction.
- Decomposing problems into classes and methods and iterating toward a working program.

Why it mattered
The final project demonstrated cumulative ability to deliver a coherent application.

## Closing — Why Save This Moment

This file captures a snapshot of my understanding on 2025-12-16. It records not just what I learned but how I connected the concepts: from simple input/output to modeling data and managing collections. As I revisit this repository, I can see how these discrete labs formed the foundation for larger projects.

If you'd like, I can also:
- Add code examples for specific labs (e.g., `Employee` class or `ParkingCalculator`).
- Create a short HTML page from this markdown for sharing.
- Tag this snapshot with a commit message like "moment-in-time: course reflection".

End of snapshot.
